## Notes and Assumptions

The product data is stored in-memory inside a JavaScript array (/lib/data.js). This means data will reset on server restart.

Image URLs must be valid external URLs; make sure to configure next.config.js to allow external image hosts.

The cart is managed using localStorage.
